This project is a game engine.

The engine make available modules and an AApplication abstract class.

The modules are compiled as dynamic libraries and run on separate threads.
They communicate via a global canal, and get the messages they want by subscribing to topics.

The application's main class should inherit from AApplication, and load the modules it needs.
